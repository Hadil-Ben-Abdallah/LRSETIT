<h1 align="center">ðŸ”¬ Research Laboratory SETIT ðŸ”¬</h1>

The Research Laboratory of Intelligent Systems for Engineering and E-health based on Image and Telecommunication Technologies (RL-SETIT) is a renowned research institution known for its contributions to advancing engineering and e-health fields through innovative research and development. However, RL-SETIT currently lacks a website and aims to create one similar to the ministry website, which already has numerous problems. These issues include outdated design elements and inefficient database management, impacting user experience and content accessibility. To address these problems, I created a comprehensive plan to enhance the RL-SETIT website platform, focusing on improving user experience, updating content, and optimizing database management.
